# PAL-1 Stuff

Code (mainly BASIC, but some ML) for the PAL-1, microKIM, and KIM-1 6502 computers.  

### BORG ATTACK!
a "Star Trek"-like game for the 5 KB "unexpanded" PAL-1/microKIM and Tiny BASIC. Game and instructions are in the BASIC folder.

### Assembly/Debugging Utilities
for the PAL-1 in the Utilities folder: the Woz/Baum 6502 disassembler for KIM, a memory dumper with hex and ASCII output, plus a little
register display program.  See the README.md there for details. 

### Original Games
Boxcars and Snake Eyes, Lil' Zilch, Lil' Yawt are in the BASIC folder. All will run under Tiny BASIC in 5 KB.

### Examples of the Tiny BASIC USR function 
Exploration of TinyBASIC's intrinsic 'PEEK' and 'POKE' routines, use of the RIOT chip's RAM to make arrays, and how to call and use the KIM ROM
routines from within TB.

### Translated Games
Acey-Ducey, Chuck-a-Luck, Craps, Hi-Lo, Lunar Lander, and Hurkle for Tiny BASIC. Plus, my translation of the classic Hammurabi!
   
Have fun!  Dave
