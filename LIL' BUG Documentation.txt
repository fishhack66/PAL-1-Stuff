INTRODUCTION
	This suite of tools will provide the “unexpanded” PAL-1 (or microKIM) user with some added utility over the standard, one-byte resolution KIM-1 monitor.  I sometimes have to remind myself that the KIM-1 was never meant to be a “home computer” like its descendant, my beloved VIC 20 from teenage years.  The KIM-1 was designed to be a “trainer,” to allow engineers a chance to take the brand new 6502 microprocessor out for a test drive.
	But then, computer nerds have always loved a hacking challenge!  I’ve had a lot of fun and learned a lot about computer design, operation, and machine language since I built Liu’s PAL-1 kit.  I hope these tools can help other users of 5K machines make some fun investigations.

	A NOTE: These tools/modules, while they work great, are a) not “user friendly” and b) not foolproof.  Not using them in the manner described below will break them, necessitating a reload of the package/module, at least.  Modules should have parameters set up *before* they are run; the starting address required of a routine must be lower than the ending address; if the program says “Enter a number less than 12”, don’t try to enter 16.  Etc.  There are no checks for errors, no backspacing (except in eWozLite), no do-overs.   As noted in the Search section description: “No niceties = tiny size -- the responsibility is all on you.”  If it breaks, clear all the status flags (#$00 in $F1) and try again; this cures a multitude of ills before running a lot of programs, anyway.  But if used as directed (like medicine?), all will be swell.
	And *please* feel free to hack this, fix it, augment it, change it, move it, etc, etc! 
		
DESCRIPTIONS and USAGE

eWozLite Monitor (Start: $1220)
	The only changes I made to eWOZ, as modified by Jim McClanahan for PAL-1 from Safstrom’s original reworking, was to strip out the Intel Hex loading code, relocate the input buffer to the *top* of the program, and put the whole thing at the top of RAM.  That freed up almost 700 contiguous bytes. For assembling 6502 code, I use the online 6502 assembler by Masswerk at: https://www.masswerk.at/6502/assembler.html
and it outputs perfect Apple I-format hex files by default (along with many other options).
	eWozLite starts at $1220, with the buffer starting at $1380.  To use it, just type a ‘G’ at its starting address, or call it from the menu. All you get is a backslash to let you know it’s running. It behaves almost exactly the way it does in its original form, but with the backspace key functioning “normally.”  To perform a hex memory dump, the “dot” command format is: <start-addr>.<end-addr>   To alter memory, use the colon command:  <addr>: xx xx xx …   To use eWozLite as an Apple Hex loader from a serial terminal, set the comms parameters in the serial terminal to no less than 10 msec character delay, and no less than 100 msec line delay.  This allows the software (and hardware) time to process each line of hex code.  Your serial interface may require different (likely longer) delays.  Then, upload the file to the PAL-1 with an ASCII transfer.
	To execute a program, append an ‘R’ to the starting address: e.g., 0F60R<ret>.
eWozLite calls executable code with a JSR instruction instead of a JMP, so if your program ends with an RTS, it’ll come back to eWozLite (another one of the changes made by F.S.). That’s it.

6502 Disassembler (Start: $1010)
	There is a PDF scan of the original 1976 Dr. Dobb’s Journal article written by Wozniak and Baum, describing the theory, use, and modification of their disassembler.  It’s an education, let me tell you!  All I did to get it to work on the PAL-1 was tack on some of Jim’s “save the registers” printing code to the end, and call that instead of the native Apple I ROM addresses.  I also changed some of the ASCII output in the data tables (- $80) to reflect the KIM-1’s character set. 
	Full instructions and commented source code are in the PDF.  But for a quick “how-to”, here’s what you do: place the starting address of the code you want to disassemble in zero page locations $44 and $45, little-endian.  Then, enter the starting address of the disassembler and type ‘G’, or call it from the LIL’ BUG menu.  You’ll get 20 lines of disassembly.  To get the next chunk, 1) tap the RS key on the PAL-1, 2) hit the ‘G’ key on your terminal keyboard (at address $0B00), 3) select [D].
	However, I suggest running the disassembler from within eWozLite: it’s a lot more convenient, especially if you’re going to output more than one page.  Inside eWozLite, type: 44: xx xx <ret>,  where the xx xx is the starting address (little endian, again), then type ‘1010R’ <ret>.   You only have to type ‘R’ <ret> to get the next page of assembly, or you can easily enter a new starting address and start the disassembler again.
	Be aware that the disassembler can become “confused” if it tries to parse out long data tables; it likes code, not data.  I’ve seen some odd things output when that happens…

MOVIT (v2) (Start: $0F10)
	From page 127 of “The First Book of KIM,” this is a workhorse.  As Lew Edwards wrote in 1977, “This one moves anything anywhere!”  Anywhere you’ve got RAM to write it, that is, likely $0000 to $13FF, then from $2000 to $9FFF, although some may have RAM going all the way to $DFFF.  See Lew’s commented source code in the book for details of operation.  Briefly: 
	Before running this, enter the starting address of the code to move into $D0 and $D1 (little endian).  The end of the code to move goes into $D2 and $D3.  Finally, put the target address into $D4 and $D5.  Then, set the address to $0F10 and hit ‘G’ to make the magic happen.  Or run from the menu at $0B00, or from within eWozLite – your choice.
	I added a little press-a-key routine before actual execution, because this is a “destructive” program; if the right values are not set beforehand, one could unintentionally write over needed data that was not yet saved.  Last, I added a little "OK" message, to let the user know that things went through.  I also added Lew's suggestion (in FBOK) to have the program break back to the KIM monitor showing the last address written.

LIL’ FILL (Start: $0E50)
	To the original, I added the press-a-key routine, because this is also a “destructive” program.  I also changed the zero page locations to match my own memory dump program and the user can select a custom hex value (not just $00) for the fill.  Last, I added a little "OK" message to this one, too.
	To use it, enter the start address in $20 and $21.  Put the number of memory cells to write (<256) in $22, and the single hex byte fill value in $23.  Then, let ’er rip.
	This could be expanded to fill more than a single page at a time, and to accept a string of bytes, as well, but I’ll leave that up to you.		

LIL’ MEM DUMP (Start: $0D60)
	Not counting the obligatory “Hello World!” program, this was my second go at writing an assembly language program.  I learned a lot: indirect addressing, 16-bit math, printing from a table, etc.  It does what it says it does: it outputs a page of memory, but with both hex digit and ASCII characters, something the eWozLite monitor can’t do (or, not without hacking in a patch).
	To use it, enter the starting address in locations $20 and $21, little-endian.  Then, run the main menu and select ‘M’.  Or, type ‘0D60’ <spacebar> and type ‘G’.  You’ll get a page of memory dump.  To get the next chunk, 1) tap the RS key on the PAL-1, 2) hit the <ret> key on your terminal keyboard, 3) type in ‘0D60’ <spacebar> ‘G’ again.

REGISTER PRINT (Start $0CFD)
	Yep, it prints the 6502 registers.  That’s it.  The main utility in this is to have the BRK interrupt vector point to the start of this program, so one can see what’s going on with the registers and the stack pointer when something you’re working on breaks.  Store $FD and $0C in $17FE and $17FF, respectively.  Or, to use it directly, just call it or select it from the menu.  My very first little assembly language program.

SEARCH (Start: $0BFC)
	This is an adaptation of the search module of JMON by Jeff Tranter.  I stripped this module down to the barest bones, preserving Jeff's excellent matching code and label/variable nomenclature while changing the addresses and length of the search 'string', which is now *hex bytes only* (no ASCII).  As is, it stands alone without any of the supporting routines in JMON, and takes up 2 bytes less than a page of memory.
	It also must be "set up" prior to a run, much like everything else in LIL' BUG. This kept the size of the module waaay down. No niceties = tiny size -- the responsibility is all on you, bub! :^)
	Only 'strings' of up to 11 bytes may be searched for, but that gives about four contiguous instructions to look for, and that should be useful.  If one needs longer search strings, maybe commandeeer the bottom of the stack for the IN buffer, say from $0100-$0140?
	To use it, place the starting and ending addresses of the search (little endian) into $D0/D1 and $D2/D3, respectively.  Then put the number of characters in your hex search sequence in $D4, and the sequence itself into $D5 through $DF (same part of zero page as Lew’s MOVIT).  E.g., I want to search for every occurrence of ‘JSR $1EA0’ in my program, which runs from $0200 to $08DB.  I’ll enter (in eWozLite): D0: 00 02 DB 08 03 20 A0 1E <ret>.  Then, I can run the search directly with 0BFCR, or pop out to the KIM monitor, set the address to $0BFC and type ‘G’, or I can run the menu program at $0B00 and then choose the [S]earch option.
	Sometimes, Search just breaks, *especially* if it’s called and hasn’t been set up beforehand.  To resolve this, simply hit RS on the PAL-1 keypad, then <ret> on the serial terminal emulator keyboard.  Adjust $D0-$DF, as necessary, then run again, from its start address or the menu.

LIL’ BUG MENU (Starts $0B00)
	This is the start of the whole package and lets you choose which program to run.  Most of the parts have some sort of reminder about required memory locations to fill, but the disassembler does not, so info for it is on the menu.  If you haven’t set up, or forgot to, or something, just hit ‘X’ and pop back out to the KIM monitor, enter your parameters, and head back to the menu, or directly to the module in question.  I had fun making it, and learned about jump tables and the basic parsing of user input.

COMMENTS
	Mainly, I just hope someone else finds these tools useful.
	After putting together a PAL-1 computer kit in the summer of ’22, I started collecting some debugging tools from various places on the internet.  Most packages were too large to fit into my stock 5 KB PAL-1 (my attempt at building a 32K RAM card from scratch was only partly successful and not reliable), and attempts at hacking away at the source code of these packages were generally not fruitful, although educational.  And, I had hoped to eventually make my PAL-1 “stand-a-lone” – not tethered to a modern PC – as it would have been in the late ’70s, and that meant thinking small.
	What I needed were some serious old-school tools, tools designed with 4K microcomputers in mind.  The programs in “The First Book of KIM” are great: MOVIT, BRANCH, and RELOCATE are especially useful, but for anything bigger/better for 6502, I decided to look for Apple I programs and, secondarily, PET 2001 tools.  Now, finally, I was onto something…
	The Woz Mon is an obvious choice for improvement, as it allows memory examination/modification at scale, rather than a byte at a time.  What it didn’t have was an ASCII dump component, so I wrote one – my second attempt at 6502 assembly language (Hello World is always first, and I never did learn ML on my VIC-20, waaay back in the day).  Studying Jim McClanahan’s code regarding register preservation and echo suppression for the PAL-1 helped a lot, as did the many resources on Hans Otten’s amazing retro computing website.  But I would have had it a lot tougher without Richard Mansfield’s “Machine Language for Beginners” book.  Worth its weight in gold, in my opinion, especially if you grew up with BASIC.
	Some of the tools in LIL’ BUG are generally simple, even “rustic,” one might say.  Of course, there’s nothing simple about Woz and Baum’s code – sheer genius, and I still don’t understand half of what they did; I’m just glad they did, and that I could port it to work on the PAL-1.  For all the other tools, I borrowed the ethos of Baum and Woz regarding input: set up your parameters *before* running the program.  This helped keep the size down, for one thing, although I certainly poured over Jeff Tranter’s JMON code for how he did user input.  And I also thought about the very-most useful tools in his suite.
	I wanted the ability to import Apple I-format hex files, disassemble them, write a series of bytes, move chunks of memory around, relocate it (for the most part – with tools like these, manual editing is guaranteed), fill up space with a repeating byte (usually 00), and see what was going on with my registers when my home-grown programs inevitably broke (I wanted to add a single stepper that disassembled, but that was above my pay grade; maybe after I learn more, though).
	And I wanted to do it all in less than 2.5K, half what my machine had.
	Hence, this collection, build around the Woz Mon, for the most part.  I find that using the disassembler and memory dump is a little easier if I call them from inside eWozLite.  LIL’ BUG sits from $0B00 to $13FF, leaving 2.25K for code, starting at $0200: the traditional start of programs in the original KIM-1.  Further, this package is almost the same size as Robert Ford Denison’s “2K Symbolic Assembler for the 6502”, written originally for a KIM-1 expanded to 4KB (you can find it on Jeff Tranter’s github pages).  Well, the PAL-1 has 5K onboard, and while the operation is a little tricky when compared to modern editors and assemblers, anyone familiar with Peter Jennings’ microADE will be right at home quickly.  And unlike microADE, 2KSA fits into the ‘unexpanded’ PAL-1 – just relocate it to $0C00.  There you go: a complete, standalone suite of tools to explore programming and the 6502… and have some fun, as well.
	All of the parts of LIL’ BUG are available in standalone modules, too.  One way to reclaim a full 1K of user RAM is to only load the disassembler (at $1010) and eWozLite (at $1220).  And almost everything can be easily relocated to suit one’s needs (the disassembler took a little ‘manual massaging’…).  FWIW, Jim Butterfield’s RELOCATE often sits at $0110 in my computer, too.
	WARNING: many of these programs use Zero Page from $20 through $48, and $D0 through $DF.  Consider that friendly advice for examining and modifying your own programs.  :^)  Source code is also available for all the modules, so feel free to rework whatever you want (see License below).  These ports and original programs are not perfect, but they’re a start, and hopefully useful as-is.
	As Liu says, “Happy Hacking!”
