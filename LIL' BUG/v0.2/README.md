# LIL' BUG version 0.2

All this version mainly does is bring the setup of all the modules into harmony; i.e., all use $D0 and $D1 for the starting addresses (dump, fill, disassembler, etc.).  I also added a few 'niceties' to the MEM DUMP and SEARCH options: a header to the dump to make it a little easier to tell exactly where a particular byte is located, and a display of the search 'string' for the search module.

The documentation was updated, as well.

Individual modules, with v0.1 source and object, are still in the main folder.
