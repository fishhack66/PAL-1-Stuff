# LIL' BUG version 0.2

All this version does is bring the setup of all the modules into harmony; i.e., all use $D0 and $D1 for the starting addresses (dump, fill, disassembler, etc.).

The documentation was updated, as well.

Individual modules, with v0.1 source and object, are still in the main folder.
